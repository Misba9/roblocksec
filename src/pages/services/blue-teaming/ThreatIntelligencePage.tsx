Our hunters form hypotheses based on threat intelligence (e.g., "Is a new APT group targeting our industry active in our network?") and search for evidence of compromise that automated tools may have missed.</p>

This data on new malware, attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and indicators of compromise (IOCs) is used to enrich our detections and guide our hunting expeditions.</p>
